						<div class="col-md-6"> 
						<p class="text-justify paragraph0">One of the Panagbenga’s major and most awaited event is the Grand Float Parade which was held on March, 1 2015 in Baguio City. Many spectators and tourists all over the Philippines came to Baguio just to witness one of the highlights of this year’s Panagbenga: The Grand Float Parade.  </p>
						
						<p class="text-justify paragraph0">The Grand Float Parade is an annual celebration that depicts and showcases the creative and beautiful culture of the Cordillerans using the flowers designed on each of the colorful floats. The float parade was led this year not only by the City Government of Baguio but also the nearby municipalities of La Trinidad, Itogon, Sablan, Tuba and Tublay, which is composed of what is called the BLISTT area, because not only Baguio benefited from the festival but these municipalities as well.  </p>
						
						<p class="text-justify paragraph0">The floats were carefully decorated days before the celebration. The flowers were structured according to a specific, and chosen theme. They were to showcase the theme for this year’s festival: ‘’Across 20 years Blossoming together’’. The common flowers that were used are anthurium, chrysanthemum, astrobelia, orchids, mums, roses, and Baguio’s original flower, everlasting. These flowers should be ninety percent fresh for the parade.  </p>
						
						<p class="text-justify paragraph0">
						The floats started from North Drive then paraded along Session Road and ended at the Athletic Bowl where the final judging will be done. A total of 16 huge and vibrant floats embellished with fresh and exquisite flowers Every float has a distinct theme or design which made the audience awe to its beauty for example, Baguio Country Club, a Hall of Famer for the Parade Competition, used the popular Disney Pixar movie: How to Train your dragon as a theme for their new float. Another float that caught the crowd’s attention is the float of Cebuana Lhuillier which featured a French Circus with live clowns dancing as it made its way down Session Road. The float of SM highlighted the rich culture of the Philippines by showing the best sceneries here in the country like Banaue Rice Terraces, Gardens of Malasag in Cagayan de Oro, and Zamboanga’s golf courses. </p>
						
						<p class="text-justify paragraph0">Not only that, street dancers also performed in the Parade like Mabini Elementary School which became the champion for the Grand Street Parade Elementary Division. Overall the parade still gave the ‘’wow-factor’’ even though this year very few of the celebrities rode the floats. This didn’t stop the audience nor the spectators to enjoy and to be amazed by the spectacular Grand Float Parade.  </p>
