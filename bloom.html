Every year, Session Road is opened for multiple guests and citizens who visit Baguio to enjoy the festival. The road is closed for public and private transportations to give space to the booths and stalls of different corporations. This yearâ€™s event was held for only a week which started after the Grand Float Parade on March. 
<br><br>Sellers and establishment owners come from multiple places from all over the country to sell their products to the public. These products range from food and beverages to shoes and bags. They also sell souvenirs for visiting tourists for them to take home. There are also some artists who come to Baguio, and they hold concerts almost every night of the week- long event. Not only is this helpful to the establishment, but it is also convenient for the public because they can find their necessities in one place. This event also helps in boosting the popularity of the establishments, the city and the festival.
<br><br>This event gives families an opportunity to bond and to enjoy the festival together. It is also easily accessible as it is held in a convenient place, the heart of Baguio city. Session Road in Bloom is one of the most influential events of this festival because it brings prosperity to the city and its citizens.
