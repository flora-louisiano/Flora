						<p class="text-justify paragraph0">It all began when lawyer, Dammy Bangaoet Jr., John Hay Poro Point Development Corporation (JPDC) Managing Director for Camp John Hay, presented to the Board of Directors of JPDC the idea of their spearheading the holding of a flower festival in Baguio City. </p>
						<p class="text-justify paragraph0">The Panagbenga is among his ideas that he loved the most. Its celebration has been successful over the past years in bringing in tourists. 
						Bangaoet, otherwise known as "Dammy",  is known as the "Father of Panagbenga" which he found in 1995, but to some, he is more than just that. </p>
						
						<p class="text-justify paragraph0">Along with other like-minded people, Bangaoet's love for Baguio City had a corresponding passion not only in making it the beautiful Baguio that we have, 
						but in making it as a tourist destination. His thoughts have always been about how history, culture and nature could be used in tourism which will make
						 other people appreciate them. For the people of Baguio, as long as the flowers bloom and this season is annually celebrated through the Panagbenga, 
						the spirit of the man behind it will always be there.</p>

As said in the interview, his father was part of several landscaping competitions, but back then, there were only two categories, the open category and the Cordillera themed category. As of now, some changes have been made, so the open category, vertical landscape and the carpet of flowers took place over the two earlier categories. </p>
