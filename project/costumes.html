We cannot deny that Panagbenga is a much awaited festival. Yearly, people from all around the country and the world visit the city of Baguio for this festival. Part of the festivalâ€™s appeal is the costumes worn by the performers and participants.
From the street dance performers to the people on the floats, Panagbenga performers have one obvious thing in common. It is the use of colors to creatively showcase the festive aura of the whole city. The participants also often combine their creativity with the native attires to help showcase the Cordilleran pride.
Other than that, the performers also base their designs on flowers. They often use sunflowers to decorate their costumes and props. The use of flowers makes the costume relevant to the festival itself. Panagbenga is the flower festival after all.
