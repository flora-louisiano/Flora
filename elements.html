							<p class="text-justify paragraph0">
							This International Schools Cyberfair project has been a great deal in the improvement of the quality and effort that we, as students, and individuals of our age are subjected to. It was a challenge to put our skills and capabilities to the test in order for us to be able to come up with a more informative and creative output. The International Cyberfair has provided us with an experience where in we are encouraged to do our best and cooperate as a team that strives to bring out the best in each other. It has also served as a way to be able to show what each of us are capable of doing, through the cyberfair, we learned that in order for our endeavors to become a success, we need to be able to acknowledge the importance and sustain the value of each individual, we learned the value of teamwork and sought to find help in the spirit of others. Through the course and the making of our Cyberfair entry, our potential as a whole was defined. Our ability to learn from our faults and simply to move to make them better. It has taught us that we are all important and each one's participation is a valuable factor that affects our team. The use of technology has proven to become an important part of our research that starts from the build up of information we used, its convenience has helped us know more about our project and it also helped us communicate with each other faster. This International Cyberfair has served a great deal in the betterment and success of each of us and has helped us excel in the subject matter that involves itself with.

							<h2 style="color: white;">In what ways did your students act as "ambassadors" and spokespersons for your Cyberfair project both on-line and in person. </h2>
							<p class="text-justify paragraph0">
							As spokespersons, we were the ones who did the field work, such as the gathering of data. We did not rely on outside sources for data such as the pictures for the various events. We sent letters and conversed with several founders / pioneers of the flower festival. Our questions were thoroughly answered and we also paved a way for us to gather information.</p>
