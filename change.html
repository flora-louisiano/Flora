							<h1 style="color: white;"> Transformation </h1>
							<h2 style="color: white;"> What has been or will be the impact of your project on your community? </h2>
							<p class="text-justify paragraph0"> 
							Our project has not only showcased Panagbenga, but also provided in depth information about the festival. It also helps Panagbenga, which has a nationwide recognition, gain more attention from different parts of the country as it promotes the events, and the history of the festival. It gives light to topics such as the history and forefathers, as many people, even the locals, donâ€™t even know how and who started the festival. It encourages the people to visit our city and to learn more about our culture while they experience the beauty and the excitement of the celebration.</p>
							
							<h2 style="color: white;"> How did your project involve other members of your community as helpers and volunteers? </h2>
							<p class="text-justify paragraph0"> 
							Our project involved the members of our community because when we asked for help from them they reached their hands out to us which helped us accomplish our website successfully. These people include our parents, who were continuously present to support and guide us in what we endeavored to do, the people in our community who were open to letting us interview them, their kindness and openness that allowed us to appreciate the wisdom and knowledge they had shared with us to help us accomplish this project. The knowledge that we bore as students in our community was limited, which is why the information that the poeple shared with us helped us expound our ideas and make us realize that there were many more things to learn. It was a difficult process to contact and make appointments with the people we recognized, during the making of our project, the Panagbenga festival was on going which gave them a busy schedule and a hectic agenda, but even so, the support from our school enabled us to contact and interview them, we recognized the efforts of our community, because of their encouragement and guidance throughout the making of our project. As students, there was an ever present scarcity in the connections that we possessed, the school helped in the growing of information we now have. The data we collected soon became first hand information and the people we were interviewing were people with big names who were humble enough to help us and give us credible data that was to be shared not only for the sake of our project, but also for the growing span of knowledge for the community.</p>
