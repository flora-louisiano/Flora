							<p class="text-justify paragraph0"> 
							Our project has not only introduced Panagbenga, but also provided in depth information about the festival. It also helps Panagbenga, which has a nationwide recognition, gain more attention from different parts of the country as it promotes the events, and the history of the festival. It gives light to topics such as the history and forefathers, as many people, even the locals, donâ€™t even know how and who started the festival. It encourages the people to visit our city and to learn more about our culture while they experience the beauty and the excitement of the celebration.</p>
							
							<h2 style="color: white;"> How did your project involve other members of your community as helpers and volunteers? </h2>
							<p class="text-justify paragraph0"> 
							Our project involved other members of our community in terms of helping us promote our city's culture. People often see the Flower Festival as just another typical celebration. Through the persons that we have approached and interviewed,it made us go into to depth of what Panagbenga truly is about. The general knowledge of the mass was limited, and because of the people that gave us their statements, it was expounded and there more things to know. It was difficult contacting people from the different parts of the city, although through the support of our school, our parents,and also the effort of our own class, it was possible to do so. The number of people we knew were scarce, and by time it grew and information was from second hand sources to first hand sources. People who were a part of festival, gave us credible data to share not only for the sake of this project entry, but also for the whole community.</p>
