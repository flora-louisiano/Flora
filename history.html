						<h2 class="title0"> 1996: First Breath of the Culture </h2>
						<p class="text-justify paragraph0">To showcase the idea through various sectors of the community such as government, education, business, media, civic organizations, was JPDC’s strategy. Its goal is to gain support and in order to accumulate suggestions.</p> 

						<p class="text-justify paragraph0">Attorney Bangaoet Jr. was placed into position and aided by the JPDC staff and volunteers under the tutelage of Eric Jonathan Picart. Ms. Rebecca Domogan, Ms. Gloria Vergara, Ms. Julie Cabato, Mr. Willie Magtibay, and Mr. Efren Chatto, all flower enthusiasts, established the advisory group. They formulated the identity of the festival that will reflect the history, traditions, and values of Baguio and the Cordillerans. </p>

						<p class="text-justify paragraph0">In October 1995, the festival used the entry of Trisha Tabangin, an alumnus of Baguio City National High School, from the annual Camp John Hay Art Contest. Ben Cabrera (also known as BenCab) chose a spray of sunflowers on the corner of Tabangin’s entry.</p>
						
						<p class="text-justify paragraph0">Professor Macario Fronda of Saint Louis University composed the festival hymn. The rhythm and movements of the Bendian dance was integrated, an Ibaloi dance for celebration. The dance’s circular movements express unity and harmony. </p>
						
						<p class="text-justify paragraph0">First Lady Amelita M. Ramos opened the first Baguio Flower Festival with the theme, “The Birth of a Tradition,” to emphasize the festival’s environmental, touristic, cultural and economic objectives with various activities to celebrate. They included the search for the Festival Queen, a Floral Parade with street dancing and floats, a Market Encounter which featured a garden show, and a number of competitions in street dancing, marching bands, as well as the Barangay Beautification Contest, and Landscaping and Flower Arrangement Contests.</p>

						<h2 class="title0">  1997: From Flower Festival to Panagbenga  </h2>
						<p class="text-justify paragraph0">The word Panagbenga comes from the <i>Kankanaey</i> is a term which means “a season of blossoming; a time for flowering,” that was suggested by Isikias Picpican, an archivist curator of Saint Louis University wherein The Second Panagbenga Festival had taken a journey on its own.</p>

						<p class="text-justify paragraph0">They also added a new activity, “Session Road in Bloom,” wherein the central business district of Baguio is closed to allow establishments to extend their lot and to let entertainment shows dominate the road. The Baguio Flower Festival and Fashion (BFFF) was held at the Mansion House. In line with the BFFF was the Flower Tee Golf Tournament.</p>
