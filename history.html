							<h2 class="title0"> The Blooming: Unveiling the Past </h2>
							<p class="text-justify paragraph0">The Panagbenga Festival started with just an idea that Baguio City should, like other towns and municipalities in the Philippines, have its own festival celebration Having been created a city by the Americans when they lived here in the Philippines. Baguio City, unlike the other cities around the Philippines, did not start as a town during the Spanish colonial period that had a patron saint with a feast day.</p>

							<p class="text-justify paragraph0">Its charter day anniversary is on September 1, which falls right in the middle of the country's rainy season, which does not allow for parades and other outdoor activities that usually are the highlight of such celebrations.  </p>

							<p class="text-justify paragraph0">September 1 is its charter day anniversary. This date falls right in the middle of the country’s rainy season, which is not a great time for parades or any outdore activities that usually are the center of attraction of such celebrations.</p>

						<h2 class="title0"> An Idea That Went Full-Bloom </h2>
						<p class="text-justify paragraph0">In the year 1995, when Atty. Damaso E. Bangaoet, Jr., proposed the idea of creating a flower festival to be held in the month of February to the directors and managers of the John Hay Poro Point Development Corporation, his suggestion received their instant authorization.  </p>

						</aside>

						<p class="text-justify paragraph0">Atty. Bangaoet was asked years ago, "Why February?" He responded, "Because the weather in February is perfect, plus it gives folks a reason to visit us between Christmas and Holy Week." </p>

						<p class="text-justify paragraph0">Thereafter the idea was presented to the different sectors of Baguio society and their response, also warm and immediate, eventually grew as a wellspring of community support.  </p>
						
						<p class="text-justify paragraph0">An identity was created that was to reflect the rich cultural heritage tof Baguio City and the Cordillera region. The official logo was selected from among those submitted by the students of all levels at the Camp John Hay Art Contest. Trisha Tabangin's winning entry of a spray of wild sunflowers was selected. </p>

								<p><b><font size="5">"The hymn that wafts in the air."</font></b></p>
						</aside>
						
						<p class="text-justify paragraph0">The festival hymn was composed by Saint Louis University (SLU) Professor Macario Fronda, which was learned by all the school children. It is still that music that wafts in the air all thoughout the festival during the parades. </p>
						<p class="text-justify paragraph0">The core events remain the same: The Parade of Floats, Steet Dancing & Band Competitions, Session Road in Bloom, Market Encounter, Pony Boys Day, etc. </p>>
						<p class="text-justify paragraph0">The original Barangay Community Garden competition participated in by the different local government units, which was one of Atty Bangaoet's most brilliant ideas that was designed for the city to have as many pocket gardens and mini parks as there were barangays, sadly no longer figures in the Panagbenga. </p>>
						<p class="text-justify paragraph0">Many other events have been added with civic organizations holding privately run and funded activities, too. </p>

						<p class="text-justify paragraph0">In the beginning, the Panagbenga was a series of celebrations that were held over a period of 10 days encompassing two weekends: the first being the launching ceremonies, the weekdays being Session Road in Bloom and the last weekend was when the Grand Parades were held. Due it its popularity, the period was extended to two weeks, then three, then held for the whole month of February, always taking full advantage of the presence of the alumni of the Philippine Military Academy during PMA Week which is timed for Valentine's Day. Now the festival stretches to five weeks! </p>

						<p class="text-justify paragraph0">A few years later the Baguio Flower Festival Foundation (BFFF) was organized to manage the festival.  </p>

						<p class="text-justify paragraph0">The Panagbenga festival has always received huge media coverage because of the instaneous popularity it has enjoyed from the very beginning. Every year, visitors are treated to a display of the strength of the local community sprit as the residents stage the hottest show in the coolest city in the Philippines. </p>

						<p class="text-justify paragraph0">To promote the city as a tourist location, some people thought of a celebration to symbolize Baguio’s recovery from the 1990 earthquake. Atty. Damaso Bangaoet Jr., John Hay Poro Point Development Corporation (JPDC) Managing Director had initiated the idea of holding a flower festival in Baguio City which was presented to the Board of Directors of JPDC. Their strategy was to showcase the thought to various sectors of the community: the government, education business, media, and the civil organizations – to gain their support and to accumulate suggestions. Because of the contributions of the society, the idea of having a festival became a reality.</p>

						<p class="text-justify paragraph0">To turn the concept into a reality, Attorney Bangaoet was placed into position with the additional manpower which came from the JPDC staff and volunteers led by Eric Jonathan Picart. Also, Rebecca Domogan, Gloria Vergara, Julie Cabato, Willie Magtibay, and Efren Chatto, all flower enthusiasts, established an advisory group. They formulated the identity of the festival, something that will reflect the history, traditions, and values of Baguio as well as the Cordillerans. </p>

						<p class="text-justify paragraph0">In October 1995, the festival acquired the face from the entries of the Annual Camp John Hay Art Contest whose theme revolved around preserving the environment with special emphasis on the flowers of Cordillera. The distinguished board of judges led by the well-known Ben Cabrera <a href="http://www.bencabmuseum.org/">(BenCab)</a> chose a spray of sunflowers on the corner of the entry of Trisha Tabangin, an alumnus of Baguio City National High School. </p>

						<p class="text-justify paragraph0">First Lady Mrs. Amelita M. Ramos, opened the First Baguio Flower Festival with the theme, “The Birth of a Tradition,” to highlight the festival’s environmental, touristic, cultural and economic objectives, with various activities to celebrate it. They included the search for the Festival Queen, a Floral Parade with street dancing and floats, a Market Encounter which featured a garden show, and a number of competitions in street dancing, marching bands, as well as the Barangay Beautification Contest, and Landscaping and Flower Arrangement Contests. </p>

						<p class="text-justify paragraph0">The word Panagbenga, which comes from the <i>Kankanaey</i> term for “a season of blossoming, a time of flowering,” was suggested by Mr. Isikias Picpican, an archivist and curator of Saint Louis University Museum wherein the second Panagbenga had taken on a journey on its own.</p>
